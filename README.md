#Machine Programmer

Make specifications for your programs, and allow the computer to evolve the
solutions. 

##This project has several components:

* OpenCL compatible virtual machine for Pyash, the SPEL core-language (alpha)
* Machine programmer for evolving Pyash programs in OpenCL on GPU/CPU  (alpha)
* Compiler for converting Pyash byte-code to other languages like LLVM (concept)

##Development Status
As of Aug 2016, this is just a prototype under active development. 
It is expected that once the Machine Programmer can contribute to it's own code
base, that the rate of development will increase. 

Even now it has some useful AGPLv3, OpenCL code, which can be adapted to
other projects. 

##Installation
Details for installation and compilation in the INSTALL file.

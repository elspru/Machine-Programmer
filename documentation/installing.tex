\section{Introduction}
This is a guide for how to install Machine Programmer on Ubuntu Linux.
Ubuntu Linux is perhaps the most popular Linux Distribution,
also it is free to download and install (though donations are welcome).
So if you have the misfortune of having a Micrsoft or Apple computer, 
feel free to format it and install Ubuntu Linux,
or set up a dual boot, if you need to transition slowly.  

The version of Ubuntu Linux this tutorial will be refering to is 16.04 or
Xenial, the current long-term-support release. 

If you use a different version of Linux, I'm sure can adapt the package names to
those which are suitable for your distribution.  If you'd like to document how
you did it then can forward it and will add your manual also.

\section{Dependencies}
As with any package the most difficult part is getting the dependencies
installed.

needs autotools to compile
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install autoconf automake libtool build-essential
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{OpenCL}
The hardest part of compiling this is probably installing OpenCL.
If you have that down, can simply:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && binary/programmer
\end{lstlisting}

Otherwise if that doesn't work, then you probably need OpenCL,
so follow along below.

\subsection{CPU OpenCL Installation}

If you don't have an OpenCL compatible GPU, then you'll have to install 
Portable Open Compute Library or
\href{http://pocl.sourceforge.net/}{POCL}.

POCL has some dependencies on Ubuntu
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install libhwloc-dev zlib1g-dev libclang-dev libx11-dev ocl-icd-dev cmake
\end{lstlisting}

Then if you are sure you don't have GPU drivers, as installing this package may
conflict with any GPU drivers you may install:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
\end{lstlisting}

then compile POCL based on it's instructions, if it's being difficult, can try
the cmake part of the instructions, as cmake may give you additional
dependencies. 

If you find that the dependencies I listed about are insufficient, then please
email me with how you got it working.

Otherwise once you have POCL can simply 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && binary/programmer
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{GPU  OpenCL Installation}

\subsubsection{(ARM) Mali GPU's (O-Droid XU3/4)}

So far have tested it with the Mali OpenCL SDK, which works on the ODroid, an
open-hardware heterogenous processing SoC board.

Strangely enough, in order to get it to compile, and to get it to run requires
different versions of libOpenCL.so

To run it need to do
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install mali-x11 # and probably restart X server.
\end{lstlisting}

In order to compile need the ones from
\href{https://developer.arm.com/products/software/mali-sdks/mali-opencl-sdk/downloads}
{Mali OpenCL SDK}

After downloading that package, extract it and fix up platform.mk to reflect
your current platform. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
CC:=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++
AR=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar
\end{lstlisting}

then in the Mali SDK folder compile the libOpenCL.so
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd lib/ && make
\end{lstlisting}
once you have a libOpenCL.so can put it into the machine-programmer's 
library/ folder.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cp lib/libOpenCL.so  $MACHINE_PROGRAMMER_PATH/library/
\end{lstlisting}

Because the standard opencl-headers provided by Ubuntu are 2.0+, and the
Mali-T628 only supports up to 1.1 you'll also have to copy the CL folder 
from Mali SDK to /usr/local/include, to avoid a bunch of deprecation
warnings and-or errors.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo cp -rv include/CL /usr/local/include
\end{lstlisting}

After that can go back into the project folder
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./autogen.sh && ./configure LDFLAGS=-L./library && make && binary/programmer
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Intel GPUs}
Intel includes onboard GPUs on a lot of motherboards, 
so chances are good that if you have an Intel CPU, that you may also have an
intel GPU, which you can take advantage of using the well functioning open
source beignet drivers.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install beignet beignet-dev beignet-opencl-icd
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Nvidia GPUs}
Unfortunately there are no libre drivers for Nvidia that have OpenCL support,
however there are proprietary drivers, which may work in certain cases. 
Note this means you can't use UEFI, common on modern laptops, you'll have to
disable it in the bios.  Also this could make breaking changes so I advise you
backup your data before attempting to install proprietary drivers. 

There are a variety of versions of the nvidia drivers, this is because they are
very finicky and they might not all work with your GPU card.  For instance I had
to try several, and spend several days testing, before I finally figured out
which ones worked. 

The best one for my GeForce GTX 960M, is nvidia-361. I tried their recommended
nvidia-367 and nvidia-370 those didn't work, and nvidia-340 didn't even show any
picture on the screen (good thing I had ssh). 

So I would advise you backup your system, and install ssh, so you could ssh
tunnel into your computer and fix it in case the monitor stops working due to
incompatible drivers. 

If you have a GeForce GTX 960M, then can do
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install nvidia-361 
\end{lstlisting}

You may find it doesn't work well with the standard dev packs, something I was
struggling with for days.  But fortunately can install the open source ones 
for Intel.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install beignet-opencl-icd
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Other GPU's}
You would have to see what is available for your platform,
if you have success in getting OpenCL, then please write up a summary and email
me.

\section{Developing}

If you would like to help with development, need some additional packages.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
apt-get install clang-format git
\end{lstlisting}
